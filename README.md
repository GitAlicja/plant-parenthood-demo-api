## Plant Parenthood Demo API

API built and deployed on Heroku in order to replace public Trefle API–used initially for the Plant Parenthood project–which has been discontinued.

**Tech stack: JavaScript, Express.js**

Demo API was created for presentational reasons only and allows searching limited number of plants, i.e. lavender, peony, lilac.
